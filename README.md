# Snake Game

I wrote this JavaScript snake game as a programming exercise. It took me about two hours. The snake starts with three segments in a random direction. The player's goal is to eat apples `a` without colliding with the walls or the snake segments. The game will get faster every 4th apple

## TODO

- Don't allow colliding with the snake by moving in the opposite direction
- Eventually the board will run out of apples because the code is naive and will only attempt to place a new apple once
